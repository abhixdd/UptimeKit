- üî¥ **Down** - Service unavailable or response time > 5000ms

## Getting Started üéØ

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abhixdd/UptimeKit.git
cd UptimeKit

# Install all dependencies (root, backend, frontend)
npm run install:all
```

### Running the Application (development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both the backend (port 3000) and the frontend dev server (port 5173) concurrently for local development.

Open browser: `http://localhost:5173`

**Optional:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder (copy from `.env.example`) to customize the port or other settings.

### Docker (quick start)

You can run the full stack with Docker Compose. This builds containerized versions of the backend and frontend (served by nginx) and starts everything together. Perfect for production deployments!

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker & Docker Compose installed

**Build and start:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**After startup, access:**

- Frontend: `localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `localhost:3000`

**How it works:**

- **Backend container**: Node.js Alpine image running Express server on port 3000
- **Frontend container**: Multi-stage build with Node/Vite for building, nginx for serving on port 5173
- **Database**: SQLite database persists in a Docker volume (`backend-data`)
- **Networking**: Services communicate via Docker internal network

**To stop:**

```bash
docker-compose down
```

**To remove all data and start fresh:**

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
